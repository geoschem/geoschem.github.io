# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for looking into contributing to GEOS-Chem! GEOS-Chem is a grass-roots model that relies on contributions from community members like you. Whether you're new to GEOS-Chem or a longtime user, you're a valued member of the community, and we want you to feel empowered to contribute.

Updates to the GEOS-Chem model benefit both you and the [entire GEOS-Chem community](https://geoschem.github.io/people.html).  You benefit through [coauthorship and citations](https://geoschem.github.io/new-developments.html).  Priority development needs are identified at GEOS-Chem users' meetings with updates between meetings based on [GEOS-Chem Steering Committee (GCSC)](https://geoschem.github.io/steering-cmte.html) input through [Working Groups](https://geoschem.github.io/working-groups.html).

## We use GitHub

Please help out as you can in response to issues and user questions.

## When should I submit updates?
Submit bug fixes right away, as these will be given the highest priority.  Please see "Support Guidelines" for more information.

Submit features as they are ready.

The practical aspects of submitting updates are listed below.

## How can I submit updates?
We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all changes happen through pull requests. This workflow is [described here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).

  2. [Fork the geoschem.github.io repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) into your Github account.
  3. Clone your fork of geoschem.github.io to your computer system.
  4. Add your modifications into a [new branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) off the **main** branch.
  5. Test your website updates thoroughly.  We recommend using a couple of different browsers on both computer and mobile devices to check  if the web pages render properly.
