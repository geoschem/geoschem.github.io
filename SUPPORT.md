# Support Guidelines

GEOS-Chem support is maintained by the **GEOS-Chem Support Team (GCST)**, which is based jointly at Harvard University and Washington University in St. Louis.

We track bugs, user questions, and feature requests through **[GitHub issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFBhdotYVf8)**. Please help out as you can in response to issues and user questions.

## How to report a bug
We use GitHub to track issues. To report a bug, **[open a new issue](https://github.com/geoschem/geoschem.github.io/issues/new/choose)**. Please include your name, institution, and all relevant information, such as simulation log files and instructions for replicating the bug.

## Where can I ask for help?
We use GitHub issues to support user questions. To ask a question, **[open a new issue](https://github.com/geoschem/geoschem.github.io/issues/new/choose)** and select the question template. Please include your name and institution in the issue.

## What type of support can I expect?
We will be happy to assist you in resolving bugs and technical issues
with the GEOS-Chem website.  User support and outreach is an important part of our  mission to support the [International GEOS-Chem User Community](https://geoschem.github.io/users.html).

Even though we can assist in several ways, we cannot possibly do everything.  We rely on GEOS-Chem users being resourceful and willing to try to resolve problems on their own to the greatest extent possible.
